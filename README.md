****In this repository there are two machine learning projects-****

**1. fh kaggel project.ipynb -**
In this project we took a data set from Kaggle (website) which contains data about fetus.
In the notebook we built a model to predict whether a fetus is normal, suspicious or problematic with given CTG values.
